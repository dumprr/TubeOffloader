# TubeOffloader
 Download YouTube videos, including playlists!
 Powered by [**PyTube**](https://pytube.io/en/latest/index.html)

# Usage
1. Download the repository
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code. It doesn't like to run otherwise
3. In the terminal, do `pip install pytube`.
4. Run Video.py or Playlist.py (preferred within the VSCode terminal)

# Issues
- Playlist videos save as .3gpp, horrendously low video quality. :(
